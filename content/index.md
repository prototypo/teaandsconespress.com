## Our Story

Founded in 2025, Tea and Scones Press is a boutique publishing house dedicated to amplifying unique voices and untold stories. We believe that great literature has the power to transform lives and broaden perspectives.

Our small but passionate team of editors, designers, and publishing professionals work closely with authors to craft beautiful books that resonate with readers. We pride ourselves on our personalized approach and commitment to quality over quantity.

At Tea and Scones Press, we're not just publishing booksâ€”we're building lasting relationships with authors and readers alike.

## Our Publishing Philosophy

We specialize in literary fiction, literary analysis, creative non-fiction, and poetry that challenges conventions and explores the depth of human experience. While we're selective about the projects we take on, we're committed to fostering diverse voices and innovative storytelling.

Each book we publish receives the same level of care and attention, from manuscript development through design, production, marketing, and beyond.
