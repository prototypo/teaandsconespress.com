<p>
A Princess Warrior's Journey of Love and Light.
</p>

<p>
Born at just 3 pounds and facing the challenges of a rare and undiagnosed genetic disorder, baby Adaeze defied expectations from her very first breath. In the tender pages of Room 119, author Michelle Stewart and illustrator Kiara Hoefsmit share the profound story of a little girl who proved that love transcends time and that even the briefest lives can leave the deepest impressions.
</p>

<p> 
Through Adaeze's own voice, readers experience her nearly four-month journey in the NICU — a time filled with cuddles, smiles, and an unbreakable bond with her parents. This is not just a story about loss, but a celebration of the extraordinary spirit that touched everyone who met her.
</p>

<p>
Room 119 offers comfort to families facing similar journeys, honors the dedicated medical professionals who provide compassionate care, and reminds us all that some angels walk among us, however briefly, to teach us about unconditional love.
